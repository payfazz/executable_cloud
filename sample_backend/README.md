# Sample cloud

this is executable that I used for demo
on https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BIqD2wjS3_khcVjNmjEefyoDw6qgV6hSAwtVdS2BthM/edit?usp=sharing

node that created from this cloud is CoreOS,
and hardcoded to connect to master on https://demo-jenkins.win.payfazz.com (may be not available any more)
